General:
    * [easy] Add more translation components which are currently hard coded
    * [easy] Map for Macao is missing or named wrong
    * [easy] Map for Kosovo is missing or named wrong
    * [easy] Map for AlandIsland is missing or named wrong
    * [easy] Find uncovered lines of code and write unit tests for these uncovered lines
    * [easy] Implement covariance for function parameters once it is available (in many places it's already hinted in the docblock)
    * [easy] Replace the custom lazy loading for images with the browser supported lazy loading version
#    * [easy] Create a bootstrap file and config file for every module in order to individually test them
    * [easy] Create database UML diagrams for every module
    * [medium] When returning models (backend and api requests) the permission should be checked
    * [medium] Add a good way to turn on/off voice recognition (probably a button somewhere)
    * [medium] Add a visual indication if the microphone is on (maybe an icon in the search bar or next to the user profile icon)
    * [medium] During the install process check the correct permissions for the directories and files, if they are missing set them. this requires the install script (termina, web, etc.) to be executed with the correct permissions
    * [medium] Implement a setting which lets users see all content no matter the content language
    * [medium] Implement an approval module which only runs a module/user specific action once it is approved. This functionality might be part of the Workflow module or at least smoothly interact with this module.
    * [medium] The modules use the module name for identification in many places where the module id should be used for performance reasons
    * [medium] Bug: If the pagination (next/previous) is implemented in a tab (e.g. second tab) the newly loaded page after clicking on 'next' shows the first tab instead of the tab which contains the list
    * [medium] Many models would benefit from unit and app association. Sometimes models should only be available/associated with a specific unit (e.g. news article for website, backend, shop etc.)
    * [medium] After completely figuring out permissions every API function needs to be checked if it behaves correctly depending on the different permissions (e.g. user created the model, user who is allowed to access the model but not change it, ...).
    * [hard] Implement oauth2 client
    * [hard] Implement oauth2 server
    * [hard] Implement ServiceWorkers
    * [hard] Implement QR code generator
    * [hard] Implement datamatrix generator
    * [hard] Implement code reader (barcode, datamatrix, qr)

phpOMS:
    * [medium] [Matrix] Create unit test for `inverse()`
    * [medium] [Graph] Implement missing functionality (see `Graph.php` for details)
    * [medium] [KMeans] In some weird cases the Cluster test fails. This happpens approximately 1 / 100 test runs (invalid center coodinate value)
    * [hard] Implement a decent full text search which finds texts that are similar (e.g. similar spelling, only some words in between, maybe different word order, etc.)
    * [medium] [QueryBuilder] Implement missing functions such as sum, count, ...
    * [medium] [DataMapper] Reconsider the order of the `get(*)` parameters (e.g.depths/fill)
    * [medium] Once read only variables become available many models can remove getter/setter function (e.g. ApplicationAbstract, ConnectionAbstract and various models)
    * [hard] [DataMapper] In the DataMapper when using getQuery() and then making a ->where(...) the where will often fail because the table name is suffixed with an integer e.g. `_3`. This means you need to know the depth of the query in order to manually write it. The query builder should figure this out by himself. It knows the `_INT` value from the `FROM` clause and should just overwrite in the where clause where needed. See the GSD Importer from the exchange module for reference.
    * [hard] [DataMapper] In the DataMapper implement iterable fetch. Currently all models are returned in one go, additionally an iterator should be returned for iterable access in case of MANY results (e.g. Exchange module)
    * [hard] [DataMapper] Only update changed relations (e.g. allow coder to tell the datamapper what changed)
    * [hard] [DataMapper] Implement get() where the coder can tell the datampper which fields and relations to fill.
    * [hard] [DataMapper] Implement `::withConditional()` results with a default alternative if the primary conditional is not met, and also a catch-all clause where optionally any result is returned if neither the primary or the alternative condition is met (this is extremely helpful for localization e.g. news article = show local language, alternatively english, alternatively any other first/best match).
    * [hard] [Email] Implement email sending and receiving
    * [hard] [Grammar] Implement schema modification grammar (alter tables)
    * [hard] [DataMapperAbstract] Performance improvement (intHash, ->getValue() vs. direct access for public members, allow transactions)
    * [hard] [DataMapperAbstract] In some cases the array is required in the ::withConditional() function. This seems to be the case if a model doesn't have the condition but a sub-model has it. The mapper should simply not use the conditional if it doesn't exist in the mapper (see ItemManagement::BackendController or ClientManagement::BackendController with the BillMapper, this is a stupid fix)

    * [medium] [Logger] Log dom changes to the user

    * [medium] [UriFactory] Consider to parse EVERY url with the uri factory. This however might cause double parsing and therfore bugs
    * [medium] The frontend loads the correct tab based on the provided fragment, but it is slow. Doing this in the backend can already fix this but the frontend implementation should be fixes, because this should be the job of the frontend.

//// Database permission handling

Option1: Check full query

select ...
from ...
where ...
  (
    account_permission_account = ACCOUNT
    AND (account_permission_unit IS NULL OR account_permission_unit = 'UNIT')
    AND (account_permission_app IS NULL OR account_permission_app = 'APP')
    AND (account_permission_module IS NULL OR account_permission_module = 'MODULE')
    AND (account_permission_type IS NULL OR account_permission_type = 'TYPE')
    AND (account_permission_element IS NULL OR account_permission_element = 'THIS_ID')
    AND (account_permission_component IS NULL OR account_permission_component = 'COMPONENT')
    AND account_permission_permission = ???
  )
  OR
  (
    group_permission_group IN (...)
    AND (group_permission_unit IS NULL OR group_permission_unit = 'UNIT')
    AND (group_permission_app IS NULL OR group_permission_app = 'APP')
    AND (group_permission_module IS NULL OR group_permission_module = 'MODULE')
    AND (group_permission_type IS NULL OR group_permission_type = 'TYPE')
    AND (group_permission_element IS NULL OR group_permission_element = 'THIS_ID')
    AND (group_permission_component IS NULL OR group_permission_component = 'COMPONENT')
    AND group_permission_permission = ???
  )

Option2:
1. Check if generall permission exists -> just do query
2. Check for specific element exists -> just do query but with column_id IN (... elements ...)
