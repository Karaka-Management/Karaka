  #? [Pagination] Bug: If pagination (next/previous) is implemented in a tab (e.g. second tab) the newly loaded page after clicking on next shows the first tab instead of the tab which contains the list.
  #? Make forgotten page use the router instead of the manual routing. The problem is that this was using the backend default base template. As a work around we could use the default backend template and an "empty" template for login/forgotten/ and other pages like privacy policy etc.
  #? Create a unit test which tests if a controller function properly checks for the user permissions. This could be done with specific test method names (e.g. apiFunctionNameWithoutPermission())

phpOMS:
  #245 [ApplicationManager] Implement test for invalid source and invalid destination
  #244 [JobScheduling] Implement test for Jobs with same value
  #243 [JobScheduling] Implement sortByEnd test coverage

  #215 Covariance for function parameters
  #206 [ItemClustering] Implement
  #204 [BusinessWarehouse] Implement warehouse picking algorithm
  #190 [OAuth 2.0] Implement
  #? [HttpRequest] Fragments should be an array since there can be multiple combined with '&'
  #? [UriFactory] Fragments should be accessible via {#0} = specific and {#} = all joined with '&'
  #? [TextSearch] Create full text search for files/in-memory texts and return the best matched files and the matched phrases
  #? [ClusterAnalysis] Create the different cluster analysis implementations
  #? [Markdown] Create a substr function which returns a substring without parsing issues. This could be implemented by defining a soft and hard limit for the text length. Or by forcing closing tags at the end.
  #? [DataMapperAbstract] When using getQuery() and then making a ->where(...) the where will often fail because the table name is suffixed with an integer e.g. `_3`. This means you need to know the depth of the query in order to manually write it. The query builder should figure this out by himself. It knows the _INT value from the `FROM` clause and should just overwrite in the where clause where needed. See the GSD Importer from the exchange module for reference.
  #? Implement iterable fetch. Currently all models are returned in one go, additionally an iterator should be returned for iterable access in case of MANY results (e.g. Exchange module)
  #? implement attributes for addAssets. This way we could add the `integrity` attribute for external asset loading

  #88 [Table] If a filter is active it should be highlighted/marked in the table
  #87 [Form] On edit highlight the data which is changed
  #86 [Form] On edit replace add button with save and cancel
  #85 [Form] Invalid backend/api responses (!201) should undo/stop UI changes
  #84 [Form] Remote data responses need to be parsed
  #83 [Form] Removing a dynamically added form from the dom should also be removed and unbound from the FormManager
  #82 [Form] The container element for inline adding isn't always tbody
  #81 [Form] Adding templates to the dom should adjust ids
  #80 [Form] Do UI actions (e.g. add) as success injection after the backend response (optional)
  #79 [Form] After adding a new element some require a binding for editing
  #78 [Form] After adding a new element some require a binding for removal

  #64 [Library] Get nearest element(s) based on selector
  #? [Tabs] Fragments should be joined with '&' instead of ','
  #? [UriFactory] Fragments should be accessible via {#0} = specific and {#} = all joined with '&'
  #? [UriFactory] Consider to parse EVERY url in the uri factory (see bug with auditlog pagination)
  #? [Tabs] Slow change of tabs on load if a tab is provided. Before the page is ready the correct tabs should be activated. This way the user doesn't see the tab jumping from the first tab to the n-th tab. Currently the backend rendering is kind of fixing this.
  #? Highlight currently filtered columns (maybe blue background for easy identification)
  #? If a form has unsaved content ask the user if he want's to leave the page "beforeunload"-Event

  #? Add some way to hide addresses and contacts from other modules (e.g. we don't want all modules to see all addresses etc. because some of the information might be module specific and should not be allowed to change from another module e.g. shipping address, private phone etc.)

//// Database permission handling

Option1: Check full query

select ...
from ...
where ...
  (
    account_permission_account = ACCOUNT
    AND (account_permission_unit IS NULL OR account_permission_unit = 'UNIT')
    AND (account_permission_app IS NULL OR account_permission_app = 'APP')
    AND (account_permission_module IS NULL OR account_permission_module = 'MODULE')
    AND (account_permission_type IS NULL OR account_permission_type = 'TYPE')
    AND (account_permission_element IS NULL OR account_permission_element = 'THIS_ID')
    AND (account_permission_component IS NULL OR account_permission_component = 'COMPONENT')
    AND account_permission_permission = ???
  )
  OR
  (
    group_permission_group IN (...)
    AND (group_permission_unit IS NULL OR group_permission_unit = 'UNIT')
    AND (group_permission_app IS NULL OR group_permission_app = 'APP')
    AND (group_permission_module IS NULL OR group_permission_module = 'MODULE')
    AND (group_permission_type IS NULL OR group_permission_type = 'TYPE')
    AND (group_permission_element IS NULL OR group_permission_element = 'THIS_ID')
    AND (group_permission_component IS NULL OR group_permission_component = 'COMPONENT')
    AND group_permission_permission = ???
  )

Option2:
1. Check if generall permission exists -> just do query
2. Check for specific element exists -> just do query but with column_id IN (... elements ...)
