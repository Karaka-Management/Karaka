# Introduction

This developer guides intention is to provide useful information 
for developers to help you to understand the structure of the 
application, important classes, workflows and standards for 
code quality as well as code style. The intention is to provide 
enough information to get a basic understanding of these 
key elements for module developers, frontend developers or 
developers working on the core application.

The guide is **not** explaining in detail how to use classes, 
for this you can find the automatically generated code 
documentation. All the provided information are very important 
to ensure the quality of the published code and often are mandatory. 
Not following these guides can cause security issues, worsen the 
user experience or even cause malfunction as well as make it 
difficult for other developers to understand the code.
