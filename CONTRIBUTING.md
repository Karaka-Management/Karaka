## Code Style & Best Practices

For the code style and best practices please have a look at the developer-guide [https://github.com/Orange-Management/Developer-Guide](https://github.com/Orange-Management/Developer-Guide). Especially the `standards` should be followed for a successful pull request.

## How Can I Contribute

### Suggestions

If you have a good idea for improvement feel free to create a new issue with all the relevant information.

### Issues

Feel free to grab any open issue implement it and create a new pull request. Most issues can be found in the code and have the following structure:

```php
/**
 * @todo Orange-Management/Orange-Management#ISSUE_NUMBER [d:difficulty]
 *  Description for the issue
 */
```

The issue information can be used to provide additional information such as priority, difficulty and type. For your first issue try to find a issue marked `[d:first]` or `[d:beginner]`.

### Code Style

Not always are the defined coding style standards upheld, if you notice that simply create a new pull request with the fix.

### Code Coverage

While code coverage is just a metric it is still appreciated to cover as many files and code paths as possible. Just have a look at the code coverage and implement missing unit tests.

### Features

You have a good idea for a feature and can implement it yourself, go ahead and create a new pull request.
